###Resources


My talk relies heavily on the following two excellent tutorials
[A Beginner's Guide to Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/)

[An Intuitive Explanation of Convolutional Neural Networks](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)

The TensorFlow playground
[http://playground.tensorflow.org](http://playground.tensorflow.org) 


I have kept a list of resources I have found useful on my journey diving deep into Deep Learning
